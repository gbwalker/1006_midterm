# Midterm: Physiological Arousal and Political Beliefs

I partially replicate “[Physiological Arousal and Political Beliefs](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/pops.12173)” by Renshon, Lee, and Tingley (2015). The main results appear exactly as in the original, and I have improved the aesthetics of two figures with a more minimal and unified style. I also found different results in one figure than in the original, though the overall conclusions are no different. For the original replication data, see the [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/24318).

In my extension I attempt to confirm the main results of the paper using Bayesian linear models. I find that the new models produce findings equivalent to the original ones, which lends credence to the authors’ argument that physiological reactivity mediates the relationship between induced anxiety and attitudes toward immigrants.
